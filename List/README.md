# List

## Running

The project uses the Cmake to compile, the steps to run are listed below:

	1. $ mkdir build
	2. $ cd build
	2. $ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
	3. $ make 
	$. ./vector

## Notes

	I choose to use a struct to change between const and non const iterator to avoid make the same code twice.
